* Polymorphism :
    - Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many
    classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

    - In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: Compile time Polymorphism and Runtime Polymorphism. The Compile time Polymorphism polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
        Runtime polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.

* Function Overloading :
     -  two or more functions can have the same name if the number and/or type of parameters are different,
    \this is called function overloading

* Overriding Function : (virtual)
     -  When a member function of a base class is redefined in its derived class with the same parameters and return type,
      it is called function overriding in C++
